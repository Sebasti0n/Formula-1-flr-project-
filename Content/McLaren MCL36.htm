            <h3>McLAREN INTRODUCES THE MCL36 AHEAD OF NEW ERA OF FORMULA 1</h3>
            <h4>The MCL36 features several striking and dramatic changes compared to the MCL35M</h4>
            <p>McLaren Racing today unveiled its new MCL36 to a live global audience ahead of the 2022 FIA Formula 1 World Championship. To be piloted by Lando Norris, 22, from the UK, and Daniel Ricciardo, 32, from Australia, the MCL36 is built to the new era of Formula 1 regulations, which aim to provide closer racing and more on-track action for fans.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Lando Norris enters his fourth season in Formula 1 with McLaren and looks to build on an exceptional 2021 season during which he achieved four podium finishes and claimed his first pole position. McLaren’s most recent race winner Daniel Ricciardo enters his 12th season in Formula 1, and his second with McLaren.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Over the course of the 2021 season, McLaren made significant progress on its journey back to the top of the sport, including securing the team’s first win since 2012, and the only 1-2 finish of the 2021 season at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. In addition, the team further closed the gap to the top teams, securing their greatest number of world championship points since 2012.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>The MCL36 was revealed at the crescendo of the McLaren Racing 2022 launch, alongside the team’s INDYCAR and Extreme E contenders, each sporting common livery colourways, galvanising the McLaren Racing family ahead of their respective campaigns.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Designed under the leadership of Technical Director James Key and produced by the team in Woking, led by Operations Director Piers Thynne, the MCL36 features several striking and dramatic changes compared to the MCL35M. The return of ground-effect to Formula 1 changes the fundamental philosophy of the car and is part of new regulations aimed at improving racing by reducing the amount of disrupted airflow generated by the cars. The MCL36 is powered by the Mercedes-AMG F1 M13 E Performance which was integrated into the McLaren chassis and gearbox with support from Mercedes HPP in Brixworth, UK.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>The colours first carried by the team in the 1960s with team founder Bruce McLaren are retained for the 2022 season, with fan favourite Papaya continuing to lead the livery. Having debuted on the MCL35M’s Monaco livery in 2021 to fan acclaim, the bold Fluro Papaya is now featured on the MCL36 for the 2022 season, accented by New Blue.</p>
