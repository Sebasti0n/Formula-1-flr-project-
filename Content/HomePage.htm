        <h2>The pinnacle of motor racing .</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">73rd running of the Formula One World Championship.[a] It is recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars. The championship is contested over twenty-two Grands Prix, which are held around the world, and it is scheduled to end earlier than in other recent years to avoid overlapping with the FIFA World Cup.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Drivers and teams are competing for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion, respectively. The 2022 championship saw the introduction of significant changes to the sport's technical regulations. These changes had been intended to be introduced in 2021, but were delayed until 2022 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing, is the reigning Drivers' Champion, whilst Mercedes are the reigning Constructors' Champions.<br /></p>

                    <br />The British race is the oldest in the Formula One World Championship calendar as the 1950 race at Silverstone was round one of the first championship season in 1950. It and the Italian Grand Prix are the only two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix that have been staged during every season that the championship has been held. The British Grand Prix was a round of the World Manufacturers' Championship in both 1926 and 1927, but was never held during the existence of the European Championship. It was designated the European Grand Prix five times between 1950 and 1977, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. All British Grands Prix dating back to 1926 have been held in England, where the British motor racing industry is primarily located.</p>
