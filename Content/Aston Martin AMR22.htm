            <p>Floor</p>
            <p>F1's increasingly elaborate floors, complete with winglets on the bargeboard, are out for 2022. Helping to tidy up 'dirty air', it's also a complete change of philosophy with the majority of downforce now generated from under the car. There's been a reduction in down force levels as a result, so keep an eye on how teams develop this area in 2022.</p>

            <p>Out with the complex bargeboards, in with the simpler, sleeker design to help cars follow more closely.</p>

            <p><b>Front wing </b>
            </p>
            <p>A car's aero platform begins at the front of the car because it's the first section to cut through the air in front. With the Y250 vortex area now removed, the vortices generating huge outwash are gone. In tandem with the floor, there's less downforce on offer initially, but the simpler design should help cars follow more closely.</p>

            <p><b>Tyres</b>
            </p>
            <p>A more road-relevant 18-inch tyre is beneficial for Pirelli, but the new compounds will allow drivers to push harder for longer, hopefully encouraging more wheel-to-wheel racing. With wheel covers and more challenging airflow to the brakes, affecting performance as a result, expect development to be constant in this area.</p>

            <p><b>Back to the Future </b>
            </p>
            <p>Ground effect evokes memories of F1's past, and it's making a comeback in 2022. The previous generation of cars had become incredibly complex, with the aerodynamic devices on the bargeboard area alone showing an innate ability to create huge amounts of 'dirty air'. The wake of the car ahead made it difficult for a car behind to follow without a loss of downforce and increased tyre degradation. Solving this problem, therefore, lies in ground effect.</p>
